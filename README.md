# Predicting Bioactivity of Histone Deacetylase (HDAC) Inhibitors

This project is based off previous work from The Data Professor: https://github.com/dataprofessor that focused on building a model for predicting the bioactivity activity of acetylcholinesterase inhibitors. 

For this project, I chose a different protein target, HDAC. This protein is generally associated with inhibition of gene transcription among other regulatory functions. HDAC inhibitors are a class of anti-cancer agents with two (vorinostat and depsipetide) FDA approved for clinical use in cancer patients. This project includes the loading of data from the ChEMBL database, data exploration and model building.
